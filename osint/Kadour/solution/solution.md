## Solution     
The first thing that came into my mind was to google up the name Kadour Tan, yet i found nothing intresting.   
So I thought why not search the name in github :   
lesgoo we found a user:

Let's check out his account : [repo link ](https://github.com/kadourtan)    
     
There are 4 repos : 
- a repo with a weird encrypted name that seems like base64 : **"aGludHM"** when decoding it with cybercheff from base64 we get the word **"hints"**, it has a txt file with the name something_you_wouldnt_like.txt which contains some quotes amongst them :
> "what looks like a simple string could be the missing piece of the puzzle." and "Sometimes, data is hidden where you least expect itâ€”like". lets move on and see maybe those quotes will come in handy.       
- another repo with an encrypted base64 name :**"YmFja2Rvb3I"** which when decoding reads as **"backdoor"**. movin on
- a repo named bit-l93ad it has a zipped file in it named work. I downloaded it but i couldnt open it : it needs a password
- a repo named private configs with a python script named security tools : the scrupt prompts the user into entering a password then hashes it into sha256. It also stores a weird encrypted string into a variable named **hidden_passphrase** 
  when decoding it we get the word **"fake_password"**. it's clearly there to throw us off.
  Lets look somewhere else. I noticed the repo has a previous commit : lets check it out
  It contains a similair code however another encrypted word is getting stored into the **hidden_passphrase** variable. when decoding it we got : **"passtan"**
  Lets try and put it into the zipped file.
     
LESSGOO WE GOT IN
      
It contains a secret.txt file which appears to be a security incident log, specifically an SSH intrusion log, however there is something that cought my eye :
  > [2025-02-12 03:18:40] command: touch -.-- --- ..- .----. .-. . ..--.- ... --- ..--.- -.-. .-.. --- ... . ..--.- -.- . . .--. ..--.- .-.. --- --- -.- .. -. --. ..--.- .... . .-. . .-.-.- .-.-.- .-.-.-

It looks like morse code. lets decode it using cybercheff:

Lets keep looking. oh look another one :
  >    [2025-02-12 03:45:12] command: echo"-- .. -.-. .-. --- -.-. - ..-.  -.-- ----- ..- ..--.- -.. .---- -.. ..--.- ....- ..--.- --. .-. ...-- ....- --... ..--.- .--- ----- ---.. ..--.- ..... --... ....- .-.. -.- .---- -. --. ..--.- -- ...-- " > /dev/null       
                    
and when decoding it we get :
